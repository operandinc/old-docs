Search is the fundamental operation of the API, and is purely extractive, i.e. involves finding the most relevant content for a given query. We support a number of different search "variants", i.e. differently structured search engines optimized for specific use-cases.

It's important to note that Operand is a _semantic search engine_, meaning it focuses on finding the most relevant content and ideas for a given query, and not on finding text snippets with identically matching content. For instance, searching for a particular email address or unique identifer will not return correct results, and is a use-case we do not support at the moment. Additionally, it is incorrect to assume that identical content will always be returned for a given query, there is often more relevant content available and we prefer to return that. For a more traditional (full-text) search experience, we recommend looking elsewhere:

- [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/)
- [Meilisearch](https://www.meilisearch.com/)
- [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/)

## Variants

### Content Based

Content-based search involves searching over the content and ideas of your objects, i.e. sentences and paragraphs. For example, when searching over a collection of essays, a content-based search might return several snippets of text that talk about ideas related to the query.

Parameters:

- The `query` is the search query. It must not be empty.
- `parentIds` is an array of object IDs to search within. Searches will be scoped to these objects (and their children) only. Optional, if not specified, will search over all objects in your index.
- `max` is the maximum number of content-based search results to return. Note: In some cases, we may return fewer results than this. Defaults to 5.
- `filter` is the optional filter object. See [Filtering](/operations#filtering) for more information.

Some notes:

- We return an array of content snippets, each with the content itself, the relevant object ID, the type of content, and the relevancy score (a number between 0 and 1).
- We also return a map of object IDs to objects, i.e. including any objects from which content results were derived.

### Object Based

Object-based search is perhaps a more traditional search experience, since it involves searching over and finding the most relevant objects (documents) for a given search query. Often, end-users are more accustomed to seeing document-based search results (complete with titles and snippets) than content-based search results, which from a UI/UX perspective, can be tricky to display properly.

**Important**: If you're using object-based search in a production environment, please consider sending anonymous [Feedback](#feedback) when a user clicks on a search result. This accomplishes two things:

- It improves the quality of your search results. Operand learns on its own from your user's clicks, and will use the information to yield better search results over time.
- It helps us understand how people use Operand, and can help us improve the user experience as a whole.

Parameters:

- `query` is the search query. It must not be empty.
- `parentIds` is an array of parent object IDs. Similar to content-based search, we scope search results to these objects and their children. If not specified, we search over your entire index.
- `max` is the maximum number of objects to return. If not specified, we default to 5. Note: We may return fewer than this number of objects in some cases.
- `filter` is the optional filter object. See [Filtering](/operations#filtering) for more information.

Some notes:

- As you can likely tell, search results here follow a much simpler format than content-based search results, or at least more familiar. A set of objects are returned, in order, along with a snippet of text which pulls relevant content from the particular object into the search result.

### Related Objects

The related object operation is used to identify relationships between objects themselves, i.e. to find the most similar object(s) to any given object. This is uniquely powerful when objects represent certain types of entities, such as people, blog posts, or even places. We expect this search variant to be heavily used within blogs or knowledge bases (finding related content to what the user is currently viewing) or within CRMs (finding related people to a given person).

Parameters:

- `objectId` is the ID of the object to find related objects for.
- `parentIds` is a list of object IDs to scope the search within, i.e. these objects (and their children) are the only objects which will be considered.
- `max` is the maximum number of related objects to return. In some cases, we may return fewer.
- `filter` is the optional filter object. See [Filtering](/operations#filtering) for more information.

## Feedback

We heavily encourage all users using [Object-Based Search](#object-based) in production to send feedback as part of their application. As mentioned above, feedback is used to auto-magically improve the search experience. It helps us because it gives us analytics on how our systems are performing, and it helps you because your search results automatically improve over time based on the behaviour of your users.

All object-based search requests will return a unique `id` to identify the request. Feedback can then be sent with this ID, and the object that the user clicked on.

Some notes:

- This is entirely anonymous feedback, and no user information will / should be shared with us.
- Please make a point to send feedback as soon as possible after the user clicks on a document. We care about timing, as it gives us a better understanding of how quickly a user clicked on a result.
- It is OK, and encouraged, to send feedback multiple times for the same search request (for instance, if the user clicked on a document, went back and clicked on another doucment).
